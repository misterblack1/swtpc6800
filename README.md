This is stuff for the SWTPC 6800 machine.

msbasic.s19 -> Microsoft BASIC for the MITS Altair 680 which is a 6800 machine. Works on the SWTPC 6800 with patch.

mspatch.s19 -> Load this after loading msbasic.s19. You MUST have more RAM at $A000 than the stock 128 bytes or this will not work.

I found the above files on a website which I do not remember. 

TSCBASIC.S19 -> TSC's enhanced BASIC for the SWTPC 6800. Load it and just type "G" to start. The stock configuration won't have much free RAM available to basic. Some memory locataions must be edited first to give it more RAM, but I can't find the exact info on this.
